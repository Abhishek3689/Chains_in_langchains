# LangChain Chains

Welcome to the LangChain Chains repository! This project provides an overview and examples of **chains** in [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), a framework for building applications powered by language models.

## What is a Chain in LangChain?

A **chain** in LangChain is a structured sequence of operations or components that process input data, interact with a language model, and produce an output. Chains combine prompts, language models, tools, memory, and output parsers to create modular workflows for complex tasks. They allow developers to build reusable, scalable, and context-aware applications by orchestrating multiple steps in a pipeline.

### Key Components of a Chain
- **Prompt Templates**: Standardize input formats for the language model.
- **Language Models**: Generate responses or process data (e.g., GPT-4, Llama).
- **Tools**: Integrate external services like APIs or databases.
- **Memory**: Maintain context from previous interactions.
- **Output Parsers**: Format or extract structured data from model outputs.

## Why Use Chains?

Chains are used in LangChain to:
- **Streamline Complex Tasks**: Break down multi-step processes into manageable, reusable components.
- **Promote Modularity**: Enable swapping or updating components (e.g., prompts or models) without redesigning the workflow.
- **Support Context Awareness**: Incorporate memory for consistent, context-sensitive responses.
- **Integrate External Resources**: Combine language models with tools like search engines or APIs.
- **Enhance Efficiency**: Create scalable pipelines for diverse inputs and tasks.

Chains are critical for applications like chatbots, automated data processing, or question-answering systems.

## Common Chain Types in LangChain

Below are three commonly used chain types in LangChain used in this repository, with their descriptions, purposes, and example use cases:

1. **Sequential Chain**
   - **Description**: Executes multiple chains or components in a predefined order, where the output of one chain serves as the input to the next.
   - **Why Use?**: Ideal for tasks that require a linear, step-by-step process, such as processing data through multiple transformations or analyses.
   - **Example Use Case**: Summarizing a document and then translating the summary into another language.
   - **How It Works**: A `SimpleSequentialChain` or `SequentialChain` passes outputs sequentially, ensuring each step completes before the next begins.

2. **Parallel Chain**
   - **Description**: Runs multiple chains or components simultaneously, combining their outputs at the end.
   - **Why Use?**: Useful for tasks where independent processes can be executed concurrently, improving efficiency and reducing processing time.
   - **Example Use Case**: Generating a summary, extracting keywords, and sentiment analysis of a text in parallel, then combining the results.
   - **How It Works**: Parallel chains (often implemented via custom workflows or LangChainâ€™s `RunnableParallel`) execute tasks independently and merge outputs as needed.

3. **Conditional Chain**
   - **Description**: Dynamically selects which chain or component to execute based on the input or predefined conditions.
   - **Why Use?**: Enables flexible workflows where the path depends on the input, making it suitable for context-sensitive or decision-based applications.
   - **Example Use Case**: Routing a user query to a math-solving chain if it involves numbers or to a general Q&A chain for other topics.
   - **How It Works**: Implemented using `RouterChain` or custom logic with `RunnableBranch`, it evaluates conditions to choose the appropriate chain.
